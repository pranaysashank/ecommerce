# An ecommerce webapp built using Yesod

I have been experimenting with Haskell for almost an year now, but never got serious into 
web development with it. In this project, I am trying to build an ecommerce website that 
implements the basic functionality of [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com)

# The plan

- [x] Implement email and password authentication using yesod-auth-email package
- [ ] modify handlers in YesodAppEmail instance to have custom registration DOMs
- [ ] Have authorizations for customer and seller
